Your privacy matters. This site uses cookies solely to improve your experience and to measure anonymous, aggregated traffic via Google Analytics 4 (GA4).

- Analytics is opt-in. When you first visit, we ask for your consent. If you decline, analytics remains disabled.
- If you accept, we store a small consent flag in localStorage so we don’t ask you again on the same device/browser.
- You can change your mind at any time by clearing site data in your browser; we’ll ask again next visit.

What we collect when consent is granted:

- Page views and navigation paths
- Basic technical info (device type, OS, browser) and approximate region/country
- No personally identifiable information (PII) is collected

How it works:

- We load the GA4 tag using the VuePress Analytics plugin.
- Consent Mode defaults to denied. Only when you click “Accept” do we grant analytics storage and start sending events.

If you have questions or requests about your data, feel free to open an issue in the site repository or contact the maintainer.
